# Project Guidelines

## Frontend Aesthetics

When working on frontend design tasks, follow these principles to create distinctive, polished interfaces.

### Typography
- **Avoid**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, and other overused system fonts
- **Prefer**: Distinctive choices like JetBrains Mono, Playfair Display, IBM Plex family, Space Grotesk, Outfit
- Mix font weights and styles purposefully for visual hierarchy

### Color & Theme
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- Commit to cohesive aesthetics with dominant colors and sharp accents
- Avoid generic purple-gradient-on-white patterns
- Consider dark themes, monochromatic schemes, or bold complementary palettes

### Motion & Interactions
- Implement meaningful animations and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions (transitions, keyframes)
- Add hover states, focus indicators, and loading states
- Keep animations purposeful—every motion should serve UX

### Backgrounds & Depth
- Create atmosphere with gradients, subtle patterns, noise textures, or layered elements
- Use shadows and elevation purposefully for hierarchy
- Experiment with glassmorphism, mesh gradients, or grain effects when appropriate

### General Principles
- Design with intention—every element should earn its place
- Prioritize clarity and usability alongside aesthetics
- Create visual rhythm through consistent spacing and alignment
- When in doubt, be bold rather than bland
